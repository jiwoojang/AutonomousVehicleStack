# Simple Neural Net
This project builds a simple 2 layer neural net from the Stanford Neural Net course assignment found at [this](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment1/) link.

## Usage
Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed, and run the `two_layer_net.ipynb` file in Jupyter.

## Results
Walk through the tests and see the net in action!
