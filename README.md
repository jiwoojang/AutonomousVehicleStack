# AutonomousVehicleStack
A short set of projects based around various problems associated with autonomous driving

These projects were completed for the ECE 493 Special Topics course on autonomous vehicles taught by [Krzysztof Czarnecki](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/k2czarne) at the University of Waterloo

## Usage
For python projects running the `main.py` file for each should suffice. C++ projects are compiled with `clang` using the provided make files.
