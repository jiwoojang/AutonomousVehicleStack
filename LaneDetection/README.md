# Lane detection 
This project aims to do basic lane detection on still images and then extend the pipeline into video
It is based on [this](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1) project

## Usage
Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `opencv-python` installed, and run `main.py` with the interpreter of your choice

## Results
Output images will live in the `test_images_output` directory, based on inputs from `test_images`

Below is a quick before and after of one of the test cases
